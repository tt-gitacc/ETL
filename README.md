# ETL
The objective of this lab was to transform a raw dataset into a file that can be processed easily by a Support Vector Machine (specifically LibSVM). The dataset in question was all the Income-related data acquired by the US Census, which contained both categorical and ordinal data types. I began by scanning the original data set for mutually exclusive values associated with each attribute and mapped them to new IDs. I then scanned the input file a second time so I could write all the new input values to it: this will result in the adult.libsvm file I attached. If you use LibSVM, you can use statistical machine learning techniques to classify the data in this file.
